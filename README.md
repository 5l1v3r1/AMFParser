# AMFParser

AMFParser plugin for Fiddler2 web debugger. It can be used for parsing and displaying AMF data inside HTTP's POST requests and responses. To know more about AMF or Adobe Message Format, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format.

This project is to provide AMF binary POST data parser functionality to Fiddler2. It works as Fiddler2 addon and shows it's own tab inside Fiddler2 inspector tab. This addon can be very helpful when you need to parse and display what's inside AMF data.

Currently it's only providing parsing functionality and it provides experimental way to modify the existing contents inside AMF binary data.
