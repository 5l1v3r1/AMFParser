# AMFParser

This project is to provide AMF binary POST data parser functionality to Fiddler2. It works as Fiddler2 addon and shows it's own tab inside Fiddler2 inspector tab. This addon can be very helpful when you need to parse and display what's inside AMF data.

Currently it's only providing parsing functionality but in the future we will provide way to modify the existing contents inside AMF binary data.
